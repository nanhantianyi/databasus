# Client Tool Bundles Specification

## Purpose

Defines the database client programs that ship inside the product, what the system guarantees about the server versions they can serve, and how a missing or unusable client becomes visible to an operator instead of surfacing as a failed backup.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Every accepted version identity has a designated client on every supported architecture

The system SHALL ship, for each processor architecture it runs on, a client designated to dump and restore every MySQL and MariaDB version identity it accepts. The designated client is either the one built for that identity's own release line, or a client from another line documented as serving it — a newer one, as the modern MariaDB client serves every line from 10.2 up, or an older one, as the legacy MariaDB client serves the lines the modern client cannot dump. A designated client MAY trail the server inside a single release line, and SHALL never come from a line older than the server's own.

#### Scenario: Start on a supported architecture

- **WHEN** the product starts on either supported architecture
- **THEN** it reports each expected client set as verified, except for a client set documented as unavailable on that architecture

#### Scenario: A version identity served by a newer client

- **WHEN** a version identity has no client built specifically for it and a newer shipped client is designated to serve it
- **THEN** the system serves it with that client, and the designation is recorded in the client documentation

#### Scenario: A version identity served by an older client on purpose

- **WHEN** a version identity exists for servers a newer client cannot dump, as MariaDB 5.5 and 10.1 need a client older than 10.2
- **THEN** the product ships a client from a line that can dump them on every architecture, and that client is used for those identities

#### Scenario: An architecture with no client for a version identity

- **WHEN** an architecture ships no client able to serve a version identity, as arm64 ships none for MySQL 5.7
- **THEN** that identity is unsupported on that architecture and a server reporting it is refused rather than attempted

### Requirement: Shipped clients stay on a maintained release line

The system SHALL ship clients from a release line that the vendor still patches, or, when the line has reached its end of life, from the final patch that line received.

#### Scenario: A line the vendor still patches

- **WHEN** a client is shipped for a line the vendor still supports
- **THEN** it is the newest patch released for that line at the time the change ships

#### Scenario: A line that has ended

- **WHEN** a client is shipped for a line whose upstream support has ended, because servers on that line are still in use
- **THEN** it is the last patch that line received

### Requirement: A client that cannot run is reported at startup

The startup check SHALL confirm that each shipped client can actually execute in the runtime environment, not only that its file is present and executable, so that a missing shared library is reported before a backup needs it. The health check SHALL report that result without running the clients again, so that repeated probing does not depend on starting every client binary.

#### Scenario: A client whose shared library is absent

- **WHEN** a shipped client cannot start because a shared library it needs is absent from the runtime environment
- **THEN** the check reports that client as failed, naming the client and the reason

#### Scenario: A client that runs

- **WHEN** a shipped client starts and reports its own version
- **THEN** the check reports that client as verified

#### Scenario: Repeated health probes

- **WHEN** the health check runs repeatedly while the product is up
- **THEN** it reports the startup verdict for each client together with a fresh confirmation that the client files are still present

### Requirement: A client set holds the version it is named for

The startup check SHALL compare the version each client reports with the release line that client set is registered under, and SHALL report a mismatch as a failure, so that a client set cannot silently hold a different version than the one the system selects it for.

#### Scenario: A client set holding a different version

- **WHEN** a client set registered for one release line contains a client that reports a version from another line
- **THEN** the check reports that client set as failed, naming the line expected and the version found

#### Scenario: A client set holding a later patch of its own line

- **WHEN** a client set registered for a release line contains a client reporting a later patch or minor of that same line
- **THEN** the check reports that client set as verified

### Requirement: A missing client disables its engine without stopping the product

The system SHALL treat a missing or unusable MySQL, MariaDB or MongoDB client as a warning that disables backups for the affected version, and SHALL treat a missing or unusable PostgreSQL client as fatal.

#### Scenario: MySQL client set is missing

- **WHEN** a MySQL client set is missing at startup
- **THEN** the product starts, logs a warning naming the client set, and keeps serving databases of other engines

#### Scenario: PostgreSQL client set is missing

- **WHEN** a PostgreSQL client set is missing at startup
- **THEN** the product reports the failure and exits
