// Package physicaltesting holds the shared control plane, helpers and version-parameterized bodies
// for the PostgreSQL physical backup→restore E2E tests. The per-version packages (pg17, pg18) are
// thin wrappers that call the exported Run* bodies, so each PostgreSQL major runs as its own test
// binary — isolated and in parallel under `go test -p`.

// Setup starts the single-instance production wiring the whole suite drives through the HTTP
// API: the scheduler (which invokes its in-process backuper directly) and the WAL stream supervisor.
// With both up, a backup requested over the API (config-enable bootstrap for the FULL, the trigger
// endpoint for incrementals) is claimed on the next 1s scheduler tick and run to a terminal state,
// and enabling WAL-stream backups makes the supervisor claim the database and create its replication
// slot. The returned func tears them down after m.Run(). Each version package calls this in its own
// TestMain, so the two majors run with fully isolated control planes.
